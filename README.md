# üß™ DeepChem + PyTorch + PyG + Transformers (GPU Setup)

> A fully GPU-accelerated machine learning environment tailored for computational chemistry and drug discovery. Includes DeepChem, RDKit, PyTorch (with CUDA), PyTorch Geometric, and Hugging Face Transformers ‚Äî built and tested on a high-performance Linux workstation.

---

## üíª System Configuration

* **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER
* **Driver Version:** 570.133.20
* **CUDA Runtime Supported:** 12.8
* **Python Version:** 3.9.23
* **Environment Name:** `deepchem-gpu`

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Included

This environment is built for modern deep learning applications in cheminformatics and molecular modeling. It includes:

* üî¨ **RDKit** ‚Äî cheminformatics toolkit
* üß™ **DeepChem 2.8.0** ‚Äî ML for drug discovery, GNNs, multitask learning
* üî• **PyTorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.1** ‚Äî deep learning with GPU acceleration
* üß† **PyTorch Geometric** ‚Äî graph neural networks for molecular graphs
* üß¨ **Hugging Face Transformers** ‚Äî SMILES/token embeddings for molecular NLP

TensorFlow was **intentionally skipped** to reduce dependency conflicts. This decision ensures that the environment remains lightweight and reproducible. TensorFlow can be added later if specific model support is required.

A reproducible `deepchem-gpu.yml` file is included for easy installation via Conda.
